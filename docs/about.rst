About MAL Toolbox
=================

MAL Toolbox is a collection of tools related to MAL (`Meta Attack Language <https://mal-lang.org/>`_).
It can be used to load or create models and generate attack graphs from MAL languages.
Attack graphs can be used to run simulations  (see `MAL Simulator <https://github.com/mal-lang/mal-simulator/>`_) or analysis.
MAL Toolbox also gives the ability to view the AttackGraph graphically in `neo4j <https://neo4j.com>`_.
